    quote: 'My husband and I decided it was time to sell our vacation home in NH. We were reached out by many companies about offering their services. We never felt completely comfortable with any of them. That changed when we were approached by Unlocked Home Project. From the initial outreach call and follow up call from Jonathan we decided this was the right company to do business with. Jonathan explained the various ways we could sell. We negotiated a fair price and the company set out to find an interested buyer. Jonathan now referred us to Jordan who was the coordinator. Throughout the entire process Jonathan and Jordan kept us informed.',

From our first conversation with Kristin she made us feel welcomed, reassured and respected. They listened without judgment and offered real solutions.\nWhat meant the most was how they helped us avoid falling into the trap of a predatory lender. Instead of pushing a quick fix, they laid out a thoughtful plan that not only protected us financially, but ended up getting us more money than we ever expected for our property.`,

I can’t thank the staff—from top to bottom—enough for what they did for our family.
